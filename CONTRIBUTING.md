# Contributing to create-express-app

We would love for you to contribute to create-express-app and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Question or Problem?](#question)
- [Feature Requests](#feature)
- [Submission Guidelines](#guidelines)

# <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

**Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests**
You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on `spectrum`

# <a name="feature"></a> Feature Requests

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
  discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
  and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. For your issue name, please prefix your proposal with `[discussion]`, for example "[discussion]: your feature idea".
- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).

# <a name="quidelines"></a> Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/getspooky/create-express-app/pulls) for an open or closed PR
   that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
1. Fork the getspooky/create-express-app repo.
1. Make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
   ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="guidelines"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.
